Module 1 Homework Assignment: Discovering Medical Codexes within Synthetic Medicare Fee-for-Service Claims Data

# Steps taken for analysis

I began my analysis by initially loading the synthetic inpatient data from the CMS website into my notebook. I then obtained a set of columns, sample data, and the first few rows of data to better visualize and understand my data set. I went on to identify the medical codexes present in the data set, which included all the icd columns, the drug columns, and hcpcs column.  Furthermore I measured the frequency of the icd codes, drg codes, and hcpcs code. I proceeded to check for missing values in the codex-related columns. Initially I did have missing data, but after filling in placeholders, the missing data went down to 0 for all columns. My final step included identifying <5 most common ICD/DRG/HCPCS codes. 

# Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them 

Although I was able to obtain a summary of the most common codes found in the dataset, I was unable to interpret them to conclude any patterns. 

# Reflect on the implications of your findings for healthcare providers and policy makers. 

By analyzing patient demographics, diagnosises, procedures, etc, trends and patterns can be interpreted to aid healthcare providers and policy makers in improving outcomes. For example, if a certain ICD or diagnosis is more prevalent within a hospital, allocations and arrangements can be made to accomodate it.
